    text = """This is a classic example of unsupervised learning task. The Iris dataset contains 
    information about Iris flowers (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) but 
    doesn't have labels indicating the flower species (Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolor, 
    Iris Virginica). K-means doesn't use these labels during clustering.
    \n* **K-means Clustering:** The algorithm aims to group data points into a predefined 
    number of clusters (k). It iteratively assigns each data point to the nearest cluster 
    centroid (center) and recomputes the centroids based on the assigned points. This process 
    minimizes the within-cluster distances, creating groups with similar characteristics.
    In essence, K-means helps uncover inherent groupings within the Iris data based on their 
    features (measurements) without relying on predefined categories (flower species). 
    This allows us to explore how well the data separates into natural clusters, potentially 
    corresponding to the actual flower species.
    \n* Choosing the optimal number of clusters (k) is crucial. The "elbow method" 
    helps visualize the trade-off between increasing clusters and decreasing improvement 
    in within-cluster distances.
    * K-means is sensitive to initial centroid placement. Running the algorithm multiple times 
    with different initializations can help identify more stable clusters.
    By applying K-means to the Iris dataset, we gain insights into the data's underlying structure 
    and potentially validate the separability of the known flower species based on their 
    measured characteristics."""

        This value alone doesn't tell the whole story. A lower WCSS generally indicates tighter 
        clusters, but it depends on the scale of your data and the number of clusters used (k).
        \n**K-mmeans Silhouette Score: 0.5528190123564095**
        * This score provides a more interpretable measure of cluster quality. It 
        ranges from -1 to 1, where:
        * Values closer to 1 indicate well-separated clusters.
        * Values around 0 suggest clusters are indifferently assigned (data points could belong to either cluster).
        * Negative values indicate poorly separated clusters (data points in a cluster are closer to points in other clusters).
        In this case, a Silhouette Score of 0.5528 suggests:
        * **Moderately separated clusters:** The data points within a cluster are somewhat closer to their centroid than to centroids of other clusters. There's some separation, but it's not perfect
        * **Potential for improvement:** You might consider exploring different numbers of clusters (k) or using different initialization methods for K-means to see if a better clustering solution can be achieved with a higher Silhouette Score (closer to 1).
        * The Iris dataset is relatively well-separated into three flower species. A Silhouette Score above 0.5 might be achievable with an appropriate number of clusters (k=3) and good initialization.
        * The optimal k can vary depending on the specific dataset and the desired level of granularity in the clustering.
