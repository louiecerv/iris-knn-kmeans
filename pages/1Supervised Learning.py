    text = """**Supervised Learning:**
    \nSupervised learning is a branch of machine learning where algorithms learn from labeled data. 
    This data consists of input features (X) and corresponding outputs or labels (y). The algorithm learns a 
    mapping function from the input features to the outputs, allowing it to predict the labels for 
    unseen data points.
    \n**Classification:**
    Classification is a specific task within supervised learning where the labels belong to discrete 
    categories. The goal is to build a model that can predict the category label of a new data 
    point based on its features.
    \n**K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):**
    KNN is a simple yet powerful algorithm for both classification and regression tasks. 
    \n**The Iris Dataset:**
    The Iris dataset is a popular benchmark dataset in machine learning. It contains information about 150 
    iris flowers from three different species: Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolor, and Iris Virginica. 
    Each flower is described by four features:
    * Sepal length (cm)
    * Sepal width (cm)
    * Petal length (cm)
    * Petal width (cm)
    \n**KNN Classification with Iris:**
    \n1. **Training:**
    * The KNN algorithm stores the entire Iris dataset (features and labels) as its training data.
    \n2. **Prediction:**
    * When presented with a new iris flower (unknown species), KNN calculates the distance (often Euclidean distance) 
    between this flower's features and all the flowers in the training data.
    * The user defines the value of 'k' (number of nearest neighbors). KNN identifies the 'k' closest 
    data points (flowers) in the training set to the new flower.
    * KNN predicts the class label (species) for the new flower based on the majority vote among its 
    'k' nearest neighbors. For example, if three out of the five nearest neighbors belong to Iris Setosa, 
    the new flower is classified as Iris Setosa.
    **Choosing 'k':**
    The value of 'k' significantly impacts KNN performance. A small 'k' value might lead to overfitting, where the 
    model performs well on the training data but poorly on unseen data. Conversely, a large 'k' value might not 
    capture the local patterns in the data and lead to underfitting. The optimal 'k' value is often determined 
    through experimentation.
    \n**Advantages of KNN:**
    * Simple to understand and implement.
    * No complex model training required.
    * Effective for datasets with well-defined clusters."""
